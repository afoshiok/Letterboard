# LetterBoard

## At-A-Glance
Letterboxd is a social media platform where movie lovers can share, review, and discover movies. Originally, I wanted to create a web app that just creates a more complete data frame, with film data instead of just a title and log date, based on your diary data exported from Letterboxd. However, I wanted to create a web app that allows me to go through the full ETL process. So, I decided to create a dashboard with the data generated.

Usually, when I make a web app like this, I would use the FAV (FastApi and Vue) stack, that's where [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) comes in. Streamlit enabled me to create the entire app completely in Python.
